Command-line program called "anagram".
Input: a word or phrase.
Output: a list of anagrams, separated by newlines.

Command-line argument ideas:
	anagram --almost <#>
		Allow solutions with up to # unused letters.
	anagram --brute
		Solve using a brute-force style algorithm

It turns out that there is a data structure specifically designed for solving
anagrams. Its called "Anatree": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatree
